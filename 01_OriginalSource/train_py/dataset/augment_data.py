This code uses opencv to apply different augmentations to a single image or a
training dataset, which is a common practice in machine learning. Functions are
pretty self-explanatory.

General comment for all functions:
  We don't do anything with labels in this functions, they take images as
  inputs, and return images as output, but in the same order, so label
  management can be done easily in a higher level.

  e.g: images: [...,img1,img2,...]
       labels: [...,lbl1,lbl2,...]
       index:  [...,i,   i+1 ,...]

       n_transformations: 2
       returns: [...,img1_1,img1_2,img1_3,img2_1,img2_2,img2_3,...]
       labels:  [...,lbl1,  lbl1,  lbl1,  lbl2,  lbl2,  lbl2,  ...]
       index:   [...,i,     i+1,    ...   i+3,   i+4     ...      ]
                                           ^---> (i+n_transformations+1)

  Indexes for labels should therefore travel in increments of
  (n_transformations+1) in the higher level to recover the labeled dataset
  structure. Randomize before feeding this to the training, even if the dataset
  has been shuffled before, since all the transformed images will be highly
  correlated with each other, and they will be of the same class!

  Unless otherwise noted, the above structure is used in all functions, where
  the original image is returned and the transformations requested are appended
  after it.
